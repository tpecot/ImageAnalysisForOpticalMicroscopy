# ImageAnalysisForOpticalMicroscopy
Macro and tracking sessions of training entitled Image Analysis for Optical microscopy organized by MRic

For each session, a pdf describes the background required to understand the session topic and assignments. Links to video tutorials are also available to see how to use ImageJ/Fiji to process images with the presented methods. The images used in the tutorials are available in the ImageExamples folders. A doc file in the same folders gives their location in the Internet.
